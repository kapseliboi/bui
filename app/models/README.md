## Collection

A lightweight class for fetching an array of "models" from a server. No sorting is applied

```js
import {Collection} from 'bui/app/models'

export default class Coll extends Collection {

    get url(){ return '/api/url-for-coll' }

    // optional: Object will be used if not specified
    get model(){ return Backbone.Model }

}
```

#### Methods

- `fetch(params)` fetches data from url

Some typical array methods are availble for iterating over the collection

- `forEach`
- `map`
- `flatMap`
- `filter`
- `reduce`
